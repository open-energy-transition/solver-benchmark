## Comparing Memory Usage: PyPSA Benchmark's memory_logger vs. tracemalloc.get_traced_memory
```
   # Measure memory usage by tracemalloc
   tracemalloc.start()
   m.solve(solver_name=solver_name)  # Run again for memory measurement
   current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
   tracemalloc.stop()
   # Record memory usage
   memory_usages.append(peak / 10**6)  # Convert to MB

   # Measure memory usage by memory_logger
   with memory_logger(max_usage=True) as mem:
      m.solve(solver_name=solver_name)  # Solve the model to measure memory
   max_mem, timestamp = mem.mem_usage
   max_mem_usages.append(max_mem)
```

1. **Download and move *nc file to pocs/measure-memory**

2. **Run Test**
   ```shell
   python pocs/measure-memory/tracemalloc_pypsa_test.py
   ```

The result in **csv** file
```
