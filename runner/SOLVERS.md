# Supported Solvers

We support the following versions of solvers: (We use the last released solver version in each calendar year.)

| Solver | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |

When determining which is the most recent version released in a particular year, we use the following resources:
- https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/releases
- https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc/releases
- https://github.com/scipopt/scip/releases and https://anaconda.org/channels/conda-forge/packages/scip/files

## Updating Solver Versions

Use the following commands to update the conda environments containing the solver versions:

```bash
for year in {2020..2025}; do conda env remove -n benchmark-$year -y; conda env create -q -f ./runner/envs/benchmark-$year.yaml -y; conda env export -n benchmark-$year -f ./runner/envs/benchmark-$year-fixed.yaml; done
find runner/envs/ -name '*fixed.yaml' | xargs sed -i '/prefix:/d'
find runner/envs/ -name '*fixed.yaml' | xargs sed -i 's/ defaults/ nodefaults/'
```

**NOTE**: HiGHS v1.6 in 2023's environment was not released to PyPI, so it needs to be installed via git. For some reason the fixed environment file generated by conda removes the instruction to build from git, so please manually edit the fixed file to also look like:
```yaml
- pip:
  # highspy 1.6.0 wasn't released to PyPI:
  - git+https://github.com//ERGO-Code/HiGHS@v1.6.0
```
