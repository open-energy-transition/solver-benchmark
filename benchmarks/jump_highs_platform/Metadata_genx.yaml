genx-4_three_zones_w_policies_slack:
  Short description: This is a one-year example with hourly resolution which contains zones representing Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. It is designed to show how to use slack variables to meet a policy constraint if it cannot be met cost-effectively by normal means. The ten represented resources include natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage. It additionally contains example input files (inside the policies folder) establishing slack variables for policy constraints (e.g. the Capacity Reserve Margin, CO2 Cap, etc.). These slack variables allow the relevant constraints to be violated at the cost of a specified objective function penalty, which can be used to either identify problematic constraints without causing infeasibilities in GenX, or to set price caps beyond which policies are no longer enforced. These slack variables will only be created if the relevant input data (Capacity_reserve_margin_slack.csv, CO2_cap_slack.csv, Energy_share_requirement_slack.csv, or the PriceCap column in Minimum_capacity_requirement.csv and Maximum_capacity_requirement.csv) are present. If any of these inputs are not present, GenX will instantiate the relevant policy as a hard constraint, which will throw an infeasibility error if violated.

genx-5_three_zones_w_piecewise_fuel:
  Short description: This is a one-year example with hourly resolution which contains zones representing Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. The ten represented resources include natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage and biomass with carbon capture and storage. For natural gas ccs generator, we provide picewise fuel usage (PWFU) parameters to represent the fuel consumption at differernt load point. Please refer to the documentation for more details on PWFU parameters and corresponding data requirements. When settings["UCommit"] >= 1 and PWFU parameters are provided in Thermal.csv, the standard heat rate (i.e., Heat_Rate_MMBTU_per_MWh) will not be used. Instead, the heat rate will be calculated based on the PWFU parameters.

genx-7_three_zones_w_colocated_VRE_storage:
  Short description: This example system shows the functionalities of the colocated VRE+storage module of GenX. It runs a three-zone, 24-hour continental US model, with a carbon constraint and with a long duration energy storage resource that the model can choose to co-locate with either solar or wind. In this case, the storage resource is forced in via minimum and maximum capacity requirement constraints, but these constraints could be easily removed (although the storage resource has a cost of zero in this case so a cost would have to be added).
