    Sizes:
    - Name: # Spatial resolution-Temporal resolution, e.g., 2-12ts, 10-1h
      Size: # Automatically assigned when running the benchmark
      URL: # link to the shared folder where the .lp / .mps file is stored, maintainers will assign a new link after accepting the contribution
      Temporal resolution: # n. of time steps in one planning horizon, e.g., 1 hour / 8 time slices
      Spatial resolution: # n. of nodes / regions, e.g., 997 nodes / 25 regions
      Realistic: # true, false
      Realistic motivation: # (optional) e.g., Sufficient spatial and temporal resolution over the considered time horizon to allow the benchmark to be defined as Realistic.
