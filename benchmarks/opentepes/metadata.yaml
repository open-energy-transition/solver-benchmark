      Temporal resolution: 4368 bi-hours # n. of time steps in one planning horizon, one of: X hours / Y time slices
      Spatial resolution: Spain and Portugal with 8 nodes # n. of nodes or regions, e.g., 997 nodes / 25 regions
      Realistic: True # true, false
      Realistic motivation: used in the national research project "Hydro generation advanced systems: modeling, control, and optimized integration to the system (AVANHID)", developed for the Ministry of Science and Innovation/State Research Agency (MICIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033) under the program Public-Private Partnerships with NextGenerationEU/PRTR funds (CPP2021-009114). October 2022 - November 2025. # if Realistic, please justify why, e.g., used in XYZ real-world study (with link), or spatial/temporal resolution matches those used in real-world studies
