  SWITCH-USA-PG:
    Short description: A capacity-expansion and operational power-system model of the United States built on the Switch framework and parameterized with PowerGenome data. It provides consistent, reproducible multi-regional U.S. electricity system scenarios using detailed technology cost assumptions (e.g., ATB).
