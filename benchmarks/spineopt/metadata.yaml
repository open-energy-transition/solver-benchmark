    Short description: Model of the European transition pathway for the electricity and multiple sectors (e.g., heat, transport, residential, non residential, industry) of 27 European countries plus Norway, Switzerland, and the UK for three milestone years 2030, 2040, and 2050. It uses the representive periods approach with intra and inter temporal constraints to handle seasonal constraints (e.g., hydro reservoirs, yearly productions, etc.).

        Temporal resolution: 12 representative days per year with seasonal constraints
        Spatial resolution: 27 EU countries + Norway + Switzerland + UK
        Realistic: true
        Realistic motivation: Highly detailed sector, spatial, and temporal resolution over the considered three milestone years to allow the benchmark to be defined as Realistic.
