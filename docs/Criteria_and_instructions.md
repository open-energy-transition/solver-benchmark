## Criteria for the selection of benchmarks

The Solver Benchmark project is open and encourages the community to submit benchmark problems. Please ensure that submissions adhere to the following criteria:

1. Benchmarks must be in the `.lp` file format, that it suitable for providing to the solver directly as input (i.e., no further pre-processing must be necessary).

1. Benchmarks must be Linear Programming (LP) or Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. We do not currently accept other kinds of problems such as non-linear, or multi-objective problems.

1. Benchmarks must be solvable using Gurobi in 1 hour or less on a machine with [TBD] 4 CPUs and 16 GB memory (e.g. a an `e2-standard-4` VM on Google Cloud).

1. Benchmarks must be problems generated by bottom-up energy system models (see *Target modelling frameworks* below).

1. If possible, benchmarks that have a "size" parameter (e.g. number of nodes, number of clusters) that can be varied in order to obtain the same benchmarks in multiple sizes: small, medium, large.

We also encourage benchmarks to help the project meet the following overall targets:

1. A set of benchmarks that are diverse in terms of modelling frameworks that generated them, problem structure, and model features.

1. Benchmarks that help open-source solver developers improve their solvers: benchmarks that can be solved rapidly (< 5 minutes) by Gurobi but are slow (~1 hour or higher) to be solved by an open-source solver.

## Instructions for submitting benchmarks

The prefered and recommended approach for submission is to open a pull request to this repository that adds to the `benchmarks/<framework>/` folder:
- A YAML file specifying the name, description, and other metadata of the benchmark (see below)
- The configuration file that is used as an input to the modelling framework
- A dockerfile that specifies the modelling framework version (preferably a commit hash), pinned versions of all dependencies, and a script to run the modelling framework and obtain the LP file given to the solver.
    - For example, see the benchmarks in the `benchmarks/pypsa/` folder.
- For non fully open-source modelling frameworks, where LP files cannot be reproduced automatically as above, we will accept LP files hosted on a public immutable file storage service such as Zenodo along with metadata file

### Benchmark metadata

Please include along with each benchmark submission, the following metadata. Further fields that are relevant to your modelling framework and application domain are welcome.
