        Ranking Solvers: Shifted Geometric Mean (SGM)
      </h4>
      <p>
        Ranking the overall performance of solvers on a (sub)set of benchmark
        instances is a difficult problem. We offer the following methods for
        ranking on our main dashboard:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-outside ml-6">
        <li className="mb-2">SGM runtime</li>
        <li className="mb-2">SGM peak memory consumption</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Number of benchmarks solved</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        SGM above stands for (normalized) shifted geometric mean, and is a more
        robust summary metric compared to the arithmetic mean (AM) or geometric
        mean (GM). Given a set of measured values{" "}
        <MathJax inline>{"$t_1, \\ldots, t_n$"}</MathJax>, e.g. runtimes of a
        solver on a set of benchmarks, the SGM value is defined as:
      </p>
      <MathJax className="my-4">
        {
          "$\\Large{e^{\\sum_{i \\in 1..n} \\frac{\\ln(\\max(1, t_i + s))}{n}} - s}$"
        }
      </MathJax>
      <p>
        The SGM differs from the geometric mean because it uses a <em>shift</em>{" "}
        <MathJax inline>{"$s$"}</MathJax> and also uses a max with 1. Key
        features are:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-outside ml-6">
        <li className="mb-2">(S)GM commutes with normalization</li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          (S)GM is influenced less by large outliers compared to AM
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          SGM is influenced less by a small number of outliers compared to GM
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Max with 1 ignores differences in runtimes of less than 1s
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          The shift is used to reduce the impact of a few benchmarks having very
          low runtimes on the overall SGM, reducing the risk of ranking highly a
          solver that is really good on only a small handful of benchmarks
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use a shift of <MathJax inline>{"$s = 10$"}</MathJax>, which is also
        the shift used by the{" "}

        .
