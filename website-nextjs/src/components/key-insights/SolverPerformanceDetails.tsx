        The next plot shows the concrete performance of each solver on a few
        representative realistic problems from a few modelling frameworks in our
        benchmark set. Hover over the problem name in order to see more details
        about the benchmark features and why we consider it as representative
        for that modelling framework. Solvers that timed out or errored on a
        particular problem are indicated by red text above the corresponding
        bar. 4 out of the 7 problems can be solved by at least one open source
        solver, with different solvers (HiGHS or SCIP) providing the best
        performance on different problems.
