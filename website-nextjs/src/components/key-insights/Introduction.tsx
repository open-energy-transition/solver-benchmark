      <p>
        This platform contains the results of benchmarking 5 optimization
        solvers on 120 problems arising from energy system models. For each
        benchmark run, we measure runtime and memory consumption of the solver,
        along with{" "}
        <Link className="font-bold" href="/methodology/#metrics">
          other metrics
        </Link>{" "}
        to ensure solution quality across solvers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that we run all solvers with their default options, with some
        exceptions â€“ see full details on our{" "}

          Methodology

        page. We also gather information such as the number of variables and
        constraints for each problem instance, along with information about the
        scenario being modelled by each problem, this along with download links
        to each problem can be found on our{" "}
