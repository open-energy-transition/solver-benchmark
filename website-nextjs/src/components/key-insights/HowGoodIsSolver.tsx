        The overall summary of our results is shown in the plot below, which
        shows the runtime of each solver, relative to the fastest solver, on
        each subset of our benchmark set. A problem on which a solver timed out
        or errored is assumed to have a runtime equal to the timeout with which
        it was run. (More details, and other ways to handle time outs and
        errors, can be found on our{" "}

        and also categorize certain problems as realistic if they arise from, or
        have similar model features as, models used in real-world energy
        planning studies. Hovering over any bar on the plot above will show you
        the average runtime of that solver on the subset of benchmarks, along
        with the percentage of benchmarks it could solve in the time limit.

        The next plot shows the concrete performance of each solver on a few
        representative realistic problems from a few modelling frameworks in our
        benchmark set. Hover over the problem name in order to see more details
        about the benchmark features and why we consider it as representative
        for that modelling framework. Solvers that timed out or errored on a
        particular problem are indicated by red text above the corresponding
        bar. 4 out of the 7 problems can be solved by at least one open source
        solver, with different solvers (HiGHS or SCIP) providing the best
        performance on different problems.
