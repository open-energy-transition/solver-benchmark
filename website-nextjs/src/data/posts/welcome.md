We're excited to launch the official blog for the Open Energy Transition (OET) Solver Benchmark project!

## What is OET Solver Benchmark?

The OET Solver Benchmark is a comprehensive platform for evaluating and comparing the performance of optimization solvers on energy system modeling problems. Our goal is to provide transparent, reproducible benchmarks that help researchers and practitioners choose the right tools for their work.

## What to Expect

This blog will feature:

- **Benchmark Updates**: New benchmarks, solver versions, and performance insights
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Articles exploring optimization techniques, solver behavior, and performance analysis
- **Community Highlights**: Contributions from the energy modeling community
- **News & Announcements**: Project updates, events, and collaboration opportunities

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to:

- Submit a benchmark
- Contribute analysis or insights
- Report issues or suggest improvements

Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/solver-benchmark) to get started.

## Stay Connected

Check back regularly for new posts, or watch our repository for updates. We're committed to making energy system optimization more accessible and transparent for everyone.

Happy optimizing! 🚀
