genx-4_three_zones_w_policies_slack:
  Short description: "This is a one-year example with hourly resolution which contains\
    \ zones representing Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. It is designed to\
    \ show how to use slack variables to meet a policy constraint if it cannot be\
    \ met cost-effectively by normal means. The ten represented resources include\
    \ natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage. It additionally\
    \ contains example input files (inside the\_policies\_folder) establishing slack\
    \ variables for policy constraints (e.g. the Capacity Reserve Margin, CO2 Cap,\
    \ etc.). These slack variables allow the relevant constraints to be violated at\
    \ the cost of a specified objective function penalty, which can be used to either\
    \ identify problematic constraints without causing infeasibilities in GenX, or\
    \ to set price caps beyond which policies are no longer enforced. These slack\
    \ variables will only be created if the relevant input data (Capacity_reserve_margin_slack.csv,\_\
    CO2_cap_slack.csv,\_Energy_share_requirement_slack.csv, or the\_PriceCap\_column\
    \ in\_Minimum_capacity_requirement.csv\_and\_Maximum_capacity_requirement.csv)\
    \ are present. If any of these inputs are not present, GenX will instantiate the\
    \ relevant policy as a hard constraint, which will throw an infeasibility error\
    \ if violated."

    the model can choose to co-locate with either solar or wind. In this case, the
    storage resource is forced in via minimum and maximum capacity requirement constraints,

    a cost of zero in this case so a cost would have to be added).
