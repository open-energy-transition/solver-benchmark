      \ met cost-effectively by normal means. The ten represented resources include\
      \ natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage. It additionally\
      \ contains example input files (inside the\_policies\_folder) establishing slack\
      \ variables for policy constraints (e.g. the Capacity Reserve Margin, CO2 Cap,\
      \ etc.). These slack variables allow the relevant constraints to be violated\
      \ at the cost of a specified objective function penalty, which can be used to\
      \ either identify problematic constraints without causing infeasibilities in\
      \ GenX, or to set price caps beyond which policies are no longer enforced. These\
      \ slack variables will only be created if the relevant input data (Capacity_reserve_margin_slack.csv,\_\
      CO2_cap_slack.csv,\_Energy_share_requirement_slack.csv, or the\_PriceCap\_column\

      \ error if violated."
