  genx-9_three_zones_w_retrofit:
    Short description: This is a one-year example with hourly resolution which contains
      zones representing Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. The twenty-two represented
      resources include natural gas, solar PV, wind, lithium-ion battery, and coal
      power plants. This example shows the usage of the retrofit module of GenX, and
      the model will be allowed to retire as well as retrofit the existing coal power
      plants and replacing the coal with blue ammonia with 85% efficiency. Unit commitment
      is linearized.
