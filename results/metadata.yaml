  Short description: "This is a one-year example with hourly resolution which contains\

    \ met cost-effectively by normal means. The ten represented resources include\
    \ natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage. It additionally\
    \ contains example input files (inside the\_policies\_folder) establishing slack\
    \ variables for policy constraints (e.g. the Capacity Reserve Margin, CO2 Cap,\
    \ etc.). These slack variables allow the relevant constraints to be violated at\
    \ the cost of a specified objective function penalty, which can be used to either\
    \ identify problematic constraints without causing infeasibilities in GenX, or\
    \ to set price caps beyond which policies are no longer enforced. These slack\
    \ variables will only be created if the relevant input data (Capacity_reserve_margin_slack.csv,\_\
    CO2_cap_slack.csv,\_Energy_share_requirement_slack.csv, or the\_PriceCap\_column\
    \ in\_Minimum_capacity_requirement.csv\_and\_Maximum_capacity_requirement.csv)\

    \ relevant policy as a hard constraint, which will throw an infeasibility error\
    \ if violated."
